ArcGIS software plus python code to perform GIS analytical/geoprocessing steps and run a model that describes the probability of road fill failure depending on a statistical analysis of nearby elevations from a DEM. This project applies to the conditions along the specific section of the Blue Ridge Parkway and surrounding terrain at the time of study (2006 to 2008). These methods and model may not be applicable to other conditions, geographies, roads, engineering problems, etc.
